### Final Submission

There are many different ways you can test your software. In this project we used JUnit testing to test out different test scenarios to ensure that program met the software requirements. This is a good way to make sure that your software is functional and secure because it is a way to know that exceptional situations are handled properly. Creating tests based on the software requirements is a great way to design the software and incorporate the user needs into the program because the program is created based on those needs.
